I wish he was my boyfriend
I wish she was my girlfriend
I'd love them till the very end
But instead they are just a friend
I wish he was my boyfriend

There's nothing worse than sitting all alone at home
And waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting by the phone
I hope that she's at home waiting by her phone
I wonder if they knows that I want them

I wish she was my girlfriend
I wish he was my boyfriend
I'd love them till the very end
But instead they are just a friend
I wish they were my partner

The other girl is not like me
She's prettier and skinnier
They have a college degree
I dropped out when I was seventeen
If I could only get them out of the picture
Then they would know how much I want them

One day I'll make them mine
And we'll be together all the time
We'll sit and watch the sunrise
And gaze into each other's eyes
I know that he knows
Know that she knows
I know that he wants to be my boyfriend
Girlfriend
Partner

I'd love them till the very end
But instead they are just a friend
I wish they were my partner
I wish she was my girlfriend

I'd love him till the very end
But instead he is just a friend
I wish he was my boyfriend
