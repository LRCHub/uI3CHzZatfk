[00:01.73] He's your slime and he's out to break me
[00:08.98] I can feel him in the distance
[00:17.95] I have grown to see that you are better than yourself
[00:27.94] You're more real than you pretend to be
[00:47.44] 
[00:35.11] He is guilty, he will pay
[00:38.80] He will burn in every way
[00:43.22] He will taste the hell I bring
[00:47.78] He will change his mind about you
